    Mission IDs and walkthrough IDs are intentionally kept
    as separate identifiers:

    - M.MISSIONS uses the official numeric mission IDs consumed
      by the mission tracker.
    - M.STEPS contains the walkthrough data.

    In The Voracious Resurgence, the walkthrough IDs already
    correspond directly to the official mission IDs.
